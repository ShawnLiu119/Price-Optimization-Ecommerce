price optimization, price and demand are considered under turnover, assumption curve

## Hypothesis 1 - Regression based on QP(turnover) as one variable

**pros: consider Q into the variable so price elasticity is factored in**
**cons: Q and P is not simply inverse to each other. P = Optimal Turnover / Q is a little bit simple

## Hypothesis 2 - Purchase Probability Prediction (ML classcification) + Profit Optimization (Operation Research)
